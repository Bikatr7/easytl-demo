This repository demonstrates a use case for the EasyTL Python package https://github.com/bikatr7/easytl

## Getting Started
1. cd into the project directory
2. run pip install -r requirements.txt
3. create the following api key files in the root directory (You only need to create the files for the APIs you want to use, at least one is required):
    - `gemini.txt` with your Google API key
    - `openai.txt` with your OpenAI API key
    - `anthropic.txt` with your Anthropic API key

## Running the code
Pick a example from the examples directory and run it. For example:
```bash
python examples/basic_gemini_example.py
```
